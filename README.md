## Exercise

- Our live coding yesterday had messy code
    - Only one backend file (some more in the end)
    - The frontend was just one file as well
    - Most of the stuff was together in one file, no folder, no organization

- Earlier during the course we learned how to organize our code better
- Imagine that we would start to improve the code from yesterday
- The goal is to make a very large application, something like LinkedIn
- What would you start to do to organize the code?

### Steps

- That's your independent task today
- Take the code from yesterday and run with it
- Make it simple, but very well organized
- Make a separate repository
- Good looking frontend
- Add features:
    - Password hashing
    - A biography" field for users allowing multi-line text
    - Validate the data
    - Add User login logic using JWTs stored in Cookies
    - Make a proper frontend using React
    - Logged in users can publish Posts (think: Twitter)
    - Logged in users can search for other users and see their profile page

- There is a lot but you don't have to do it all!
    - The goal is to work, try your hardest, and learn
    - You have help here as well
